A professor is teaching Introduction to Programming and 
gets to the topic of recursion, but after reading his 
prepared notes, one of his students seems particularly 
perplexed and questions the teacher.

"I don't understand, you said a recursive algorithm is a 
function that calls itself?" the student asks.

"Yes!" says the teacher.

"So it's like a phone? Wouldn't it get a busy signal 
trying to call itself?"

"No, not like a phone, it's more like-" The teacher starts 
to explain, but is cut off by the student.

"Is it like a role call? Like when you call your own name?"

"No," the teacher continues "It's not-"

But the student immediately interrupts.

"Like calling a bet? You bet on yourself?"

"No!" The teacher finally blurts. "Look, I can see you're 
confused. Why don't I tell you a joke my professor taught 
me..."

He clears his throat and begins.
